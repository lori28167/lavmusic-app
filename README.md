## Building the Application

### Using Gradle Wrapper (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run the application
./gradlew run

# Create distribution archives
./gradlew distZip distTar
```

### Building JAR

```bash
# Create a fat JAR with all dependencies
./gradlew jar

# The JAR will be located at: build/libs/lavmusic-app-1.0.0.jar
```

## Continuous Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds and releases.

### Build Workflow

The "Build JAR" workflow automatically builds the JAR file on every push to `main` or `develop` branches, and on pull requests.

The workflow:
- Sets up Java 17 (Temurin distribution)
- Builds the project using Gradle
- Runs all tests
- Uploads the JAR artifact (available for 30 days)
- Uploads distribution archives (ZIP/TAR)

You can download the built artifacts from the Actions tab in the GitHub repository after each successful build.

To manually trigger a build, go to the Actions tab and run the "Build JAR" workflow using the "Run workflow" button.

### Release Workflow

The "Release JAR" workflow automatically creates a GitHub release when a version tag is pushed.

To create a new release:
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow will:
- Build the JAR file
- Create a GitHub release with the tag name
- Upload the JAR file to the release
- Upload distribution archives (ZIP/TAR)
- Generate release notes automatically

You can also manually trigger the release workflow from the Actions tab.

## Running the Application

### Method 1: Using Gradle

```bash
./gradlew run
```

### Method 2: Using the JAR

```bash
java -jar build/libs/lavmusic-app-1.0.0.jar
```

## Configuration

The application configuration is located at `src/main/resources/config.json`:

```json
{
  "lavalink": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 2333,
    "password": "youshallnotpass"
  },
  "player": {
    "defaultVolume": 50,
    "bufferDuration": 400
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **lavalink.host**: Lavalink server hostname
- **lavalink.port**: Lavalink server port
- **lavalink.password**: Lavalink server password (**WARNING**: Change this default password before production use!)
- **player.defaultVolume**: Default volume level (0-100)
- **player.bufferDuration**: Audio buffer duration in milliseconds

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: The default password in the configuration is for development only. Always change it to a secure password before deploying to production, or use environment variables for sensitive credentials.

## Setting up Lavalink Server

To use this application with actual music streaming, you need to run a Lavalink server:

1. Download Lavalink from [GitHub](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases)
2. Create `application.yml` configuration
3. Run Lavalink: `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
4. Update `config.json` with your Lavalink server details

## UI Features

### Main Window Components

1. **App Bar**: Purple header with application title
2. **Search Panel** (Left):
   - Search input field
   - Search button
   - Results list with "+" button to add to queue
3. **Queue Panel** (Right):
   - Current queue display
   - Clear queue button (üóë)
4. **Player Controls** (Bottom):
   - Current track information
   - Progress slider
   - Play/Pause/Next buttons
   - Volume control

### Material Expressive Design

The UI follows Material Design principles with:
- Elevated surfaces with subtle shadows
- Rounded corners on components
- Primary color: Purple (#6200EE)
- Secondary color: Teal (#03DAC6)
- Clean typography and spacing
- Smooth hover interactions

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

```bash
./gradlew clean
```

### IDE Setup

The project can be imported into any Java IDE that supports Gradle:
- IntelliJ IDEA: Open the project folder
- Eclipse: Import as Gradle project
- VS Code: Open with Gradle plugin

## Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Ensure Java 17 or higher is installed: `java -version`
- Check if JavaFX is properly configured
- Review logs in `lavmusic.log`

### UI rendering issues
- Update your graphics drivers
- Try running with different JavaFX rendering pipelines:
  ```bash
  java -Dprism.order=sw -jar build/libs/lavmusic-app-1.0.0.jar
  ```

### Lavalink connection issues
- Verify Lavalink server is running
- Check host, port, and password in `config.json`
- Review application logs for connection errors
